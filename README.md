# schrodingerEquationSimulator
This project was completed in a three-person group project for PHYS 2260 at UPenn. This project simulates the wave function described by the Schödinger Equation.


This project is structured in 2 parts with various sub-parts: 

Part 1: Ground State electron in infinite square potential well with different boundary conditions 

- Time-Independent Wave Function:
  a. Using Secant Method to simulate Ground-State Energy of electron in Infinite Square Potential Well (with potential inside equal to zero)

  b. Simulating Infinite potential Square Well with potential inside well equal to a function

- Time-Dependent Wave Function:
  c. Using Crank-Nicolson method to simulate particle in infinite square well
  
  d. Get Crank-Nicolson equation for Schrödinger Equation 

Part II: Surface Plot of the Particle in 1-D Box
